## Problem

The Polkadot DAO, Web3 Foundation, and OpenGov have allocated over **34 million DOT** to fund ecosystem initiatives. While this capital has accelerated growth, updates and critical information about funded projects remain **fragmented** across platforms like **Polkassembly, GitHub, Discord**, and **X**. This results in **inconsistent reporting** and **limited oversight**, making it difficult for the community and grant administrators to get a comprehensive view of projects, track progress, ensure financial accountability, and evaluate alignment with Polkadotâ€™s long-term goals. Resulting in **time-consuming and manual**, with risks of critical issues going unnoticed until. 
## Proposed Solution

**WatchDog** is a unified platform designed for the Polkadot ecosystem to improve **transparency and accountability** for Web3 Foundation, Polkadot Treasury, and OpenGov grants. It consolidates data into a user-friendly dashboard and provides live, structured insights into **milestone progress**, **spending**, and **outcomes**:

- **Milestone Tracking:** Each grant has a dedicated page showing milestones, progress bars, and completion status, updated in real-time using data from GitHub and Polkadotâ€™s development tools.
- **Risk Detection:** Machine learning identifies delays, inactivity, or unusual fund activity, providing actionable suggestions for early intervention.
- **Financial Transparency:** Tracks Treasury funds to project wallets, linking spending to milestones and flagging inconsistencies.
- **Blockchain Verification:** Milestones are securely recorded on Polkadotâ€™s blockchain for transparent, tamper-proof audit trails.
- **Automated Alerts:** Sends in-app and email notifications for overdue milestones or deviations from grant plans.
- **Visual Insights:** Displays progress through charts, such as bar graphs for milestone completion and line charts for fund usage trends.

> WatchDog streamlines grant oversight, empowering stakeholders with clear, actionable insights at low cost and effort.

## Key Features and Differentiators

- **Live Grant Monitoring:** A dynamic dashboard tracks milestones, updates, and reports across all Polkadot Treasury and OpenGov projects, consolidating data from multiple sources.
- **Proactive Risk Detection:** Machine learning analyzes real-time data to flag risks, such as:
  - Significant milestone delays  
  - Sudden project inactivity  
  - Irregular fund usage  
  Each flagged issue includes recommended actions to improve outcomes.
- **Blockchain-Based Milestone Records:** Milestone submissions are securely stored on Polkadotâ€™s blockchain, ensuring authenticity and enabling easy audits by stakeholders.
- **Fund Flow Tracking:** WatchDog links Treasury disbursements to project milestones, highlighting:
  - Delayed or unused funds  
  - Unexpected project activity  
  - Misalignments between reported progress and spending
- **Standardized Reporting:** Automated reports combine data from GitHub commits, Polkadot development logs, and OpenGov metadata into a consistent format for easy comparison and decision-making.
- **Multi-Source Data Integration:** WatchDog unifies data from GitHub, Polkassembly, and OpenGov into a single grant profile, combining governance discussions, technical updates, and financial tracking.

## Community Oversight

- **Endorsements and Feedback:** Stakeholders can endorse or comment on milestone reports.
- **Grantee Interaction:** Grantees can respond to feedback within the platform.
- **Auditor Input:** Verified developers and auditors can flag issues, feeding into the risk detection system.

## Ecosystem Fit

WatchDog aligns with Polkadotâ€™s values of **transparency, decentralization,** and **accountability**. It serves:

- **DOT Token Holders & DAO Delegates:** Clear insights to evaluate grant performance.  
- **Grant Recipients:** A user-friendly portal for reporting progress.  
- **Governance Facilitators:** Portfolio-wide visibility to identify risks.  
- **Community Members:** Transparent access to fund usage and project impact.

> WatchDog complements tools like **Polkassembly** by focusing on **delivery oversight, technical verification, and funding transparency**, acting as a **DevOps layer** for Polkadotâ€™s public goods infrastructure.

## Future

### Sustainability & Monetization
While initial funding from the Polkadot Treasury is required to bootstrap development, the long-term vision includes a hybrid, self-sustaining model through the following revenue strategies:

**Ecosystem/ParaChain Audit Subscriptions**
Partner with Parachains organizations to subsidize audit tooling and monitoring services. Small monthly or quarterly fees will give grantees access to advanced oversight features.

**Tiered API Access**
Offer real-time, verified milestone and treasury data via subscription-based APIs. Pricing tiers will reflect data freshness, query volume, and customization needs (e.g., for analytics firms, dApps, or researchers).

**Premium Analytics Dashboards**
Provide enhanced dashboards for large grantees, foundations, or institutional partners, featuring historical analysis, filtering, and benchmarking across grants.

**Sponsored Integrations**
Collaborate with ecosystem tools and infrastructure projects to integrate WatchDog data, supported by licensing or sponsorship agreements.

## Conclusion
WatchDog introduces a structured, intelligent accountability framework for the Polkadot Treasury and OpenGov. By transforming fragmented and inconsistent grant data into real-time, verifiable insights, it strengthens trust, reduces inefficiencies, and helps ensure the long-term effectiveness of Polkadotâ€™s public funding mechanisms.
