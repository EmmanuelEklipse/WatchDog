# WatchDog: A Unified Grant Progress Tracking Platform for the Web3 Foundation and Polkadot Ecosystem

## Problem

Tracking the progress of initiatives funded by the Web3 foundation, Polkadot Treasury, and OpenGov is currently fragmented. Updates are dispersed across Polkassembly, GitHub repositories, Substrate development logs, and social media. This lack of cohesion hinders the communityâ€™s ability to effectively oversee projects, evaluate progress, and address potential issues promptly. Manual cross-referencing is time-consuming for grant admins, and critical issues often go unnoticed until they become disruptive or irreversible.

## Proposed Solution

To overcome these challenges, we propose a **Unified Grant Progress Tracker for Polkadot** called **WatchDog** to improve project transparency and accountability â€” a dashboard purpose-built for the Web3 foundation, Polkadot Treasury, and OpenGov ecosystem.

It brings structured oversight to grant-funded projects by:

- **Milestone Tracking:** Dedicated pages for each grant, displaying key milestones, progress indicators (e.g., progress bars, percentages), and completion status.
- Syncing with GitHub and Substrate dev tools for real-time technical progress updates.
- Using machine learning to detect early signs of risk (delays, inactivity, unusual fund behavior).
- Mapping Treasury disbursements to project-specific wallet activity to improve financial transparency.
- Anchoring milestone attestations on-chain via hashed, verifiable records.
- Consolidating fragmented data into a standardized, actionable format for voters and stakeholders.
- **Automated Alerts:** Notifications for overdue milestones or significant deviations from the grant scope, delivered via in-app notifications and email.
- **Visualizations:** Charts and graphs to provide a visual representation of project progress and trends.

By embedding verification and automation into the grant lifecycle, WatchDog empowers the ecosystem with low-effort, low-cost, high-trust project monitoring.

## Key Features and Differentiators

### Live Grant Monitoring

A dynamic dashboard that tracks milestones, development updates, and reporting across the entire Polkadot Treasury and OpenGov landscape.

### Proactive Risk Detection

Built-in machine learning models evaluate real-time inputs to detect anomalies such as:

- Milestones are significantly delayed relative to the original timelines.
- Projects exhibiting sudden inactivity.
- Irregularities in fund disbursement and delivery performance.

Each flagged project is paired with suggested actions to enable early intervention and improved capital efficiency.

### On-Chain Milestone Attestations

Every milestone submission is hashed and anchored on-chain using a lightweight Substrate pallet. Attestations are signed using Polkadot identity primitives to ensure auditability and authenticity.

### Proposal-Linked Fund Flow Monitoring

WatchDog maps Treasury disbursements to recipient wallets, milestones, and asset monitoring. This approach provides insight into:

- Delayed or unutilized funds.
- Unexpected wallet transfers.
- Inconsistencies between reported progress and on-chain fund movement.

Unlike general wallet tracking, this feature ties activity directly to project milestones and proposal IDs.

### Standardized Reporting and Automated Summarization

Structured progress reports are auto-generated by aggregating data from:

- GitHub commits and pull requests.
- Substrate development logs.
- Forum updates.
- Treasury proposal metadata.

All reports follow a consistent template, facilitating comparison and enabling timely decision-making.

### Multi-Source Data Fusion

WatchDog integrates data across GitHub, Polkassembly, OpenGov, etc. Each grant receives a consolidated profile combining governance discussion, technical updates, and financial tracking in a single interface.

### Community Oversight Layer

- Stakeholders can endorse or raise concerns on submitted milestone reports.
- Grantees may respond to feedback within the platform.
- Verified developers and auditors can flag issues that feed into WatchDog's risk model.
- Community signals help prioritize grants requiring further review or follow-up.

## Ecosystem Fit

WatchDog aligns with Polkadotâ€™s values of transparency, decentralization, and verifiability. It serves multiple stakeholder groups:

- **Empowering Grant Administrators:** Tools to streamline oversight, automate progress reporting, generate insights, and trigger follow-ups.
- **DOT/KSM Holders:** Visibility into how Treasury and OpenGov funds are allocated and used.
- **OpenGov Voters:** Actionable insights to inform ongoing and future decisions.
- **Contributors and Grantees:** Reduced manual reporting burdens and clearer expectations.
- **Community Members:** Access to a verifiable, centralized source for project updates and accountability.

WatchDog complements existing tools like Polkassembly by shifting the focus from governance discourse to delivery oversight, technical verification, and funding integrity. It serves as the DevOps and transparency layer for Polkadotâ€™s on-chain public goods infrastructure.

## Future

###Sustainability & Monetization
While initial funding from the Polkadot Treasury is required to bootstrap development, the long-term vision includes a hybrid, self-sustaining model through the following revenue strategies:

**Ecosystem/ParaChain Audit Subscriptions**
Partner with Parachains organizations to subsidize audit tooling and monitoring services. Small monthly or quarterly fees will give grantees access to advanced oversight features.

**Tiered API Access**
Offer real-time, verified milestone and treasury data via subscription-based APIs. Pricing tiers will reflect data freshness, query volume, and customization needs (e.g., for analytics firms, dApps, or researchers).

**Premium Analytics Dashboards**
Provide enhanced dashboards for large grantees, foundations, or institutional partners, featuring historical analysis, filtering, and benchmarking across grants.

**Sponsored Integrations**
Collaborate with ecosystem tools and infrastructure projects to integrate WatchDog data, supported by licensing or sponsorship agreements.

##Conclusion
WatchDog introduces a structured, intelligent accountability framework for the Polkadot Treasury and OpenGov. By transforming fragmented and inconsistent grant data into real-time, verifiable insights, it strengthens trust, reduces inefficiencies, and helps ensure the long-term effectiveness of Polkadotâ€™s public funding mechanisms.
