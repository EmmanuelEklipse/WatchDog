## Problem

The Polkadot DAO, Web3 Foundation, and OpenGov have allocated over **34 million DOT** to fund ecosystem initiatives. While this capital has accelerated growth, updates and critical information about funded projects remain currently **fragmented** across platforms, Polkassembly, GitHub repositories, Substrate development logs, and social media, making it difficult for the community and grant administrators to oversee progress, evaluate outcomes, and identify issues early. Manual cross-referencing is time-consuming for grant administrators, and critical risks, such as delays or mismanagement, often go unnoticed
## Proposed Solution

WatchDog is a platform designed to enhance **accountability**, **efficiency **, and  **transparency** in the Polkadot grant ecosystem by centralizing fragmented data into a user-friendly dashboard. It provides structured oversight for Web3 Foundation, Polkadot Treasury, and OpenGov grants, empowering stakeholders with actionable insights. Key features include:

- **Milestone Tracking:** Dedicated grant pages with progress indicators (e.g., progress bars, percentages) and completion status, synced with GitHub and Substrate tools for real-time technical updates.  
- **Financial Transparency:** Mapping Treasury disbursements to project-specific wallet activity for clear, verifiable spending oversight.  
- **Risk Detection:** Machine learning algorithms to identify early signs of delays, inactivity, or unusual fund behavior.  
- **On-Chain Verification:** Milestone attestations anchored on-chain via hashed, verifiable records for high-trust reporting.  
- **Automated Alerts:** In-app and email notifications for overdue milestones or deviations from grant scope, enabling proactive issue resolution.  
- **Data Visualization:** Charts and graphs to illustrate project progress, trends, and financial activity, simplifying community oversight.  
- **Community Empowerment:** Standardized, consolidated data formats for voters and stakeholders, reducing manual effort and fostering trust.

### Impact

WatchDog streamlines grant management by automating monitoring, reporting, and risk identification, significantly reducing administrative burden. By embedding verification and automation into the grant lifecycle, it ensures low-effort, low-cost, high-trust project oversight, enabling the Polkadot ecosystem to address issues promptly and drive successful outcomes.

 ## Ecosystem Fit

WatchDog aligns with Polkadotâ€™s core values of **accountability**, **decentralization**, and **transparency**, serving:

- **DOT Token Holders & DAO Delegates:** Clear insights to evaluate grant performance and inform voting decisions.  
- **Grant Recipients:** A user-friendly portal to report progress and demonstrate accountability.  
- **Governance Facilitators:** Portfolio-wide visibility to identify risks and streamline administration.  
- **Community Members:** Transparent access to fund usage and project impact, fostering trust.  

As a governance layer for Polkadotâ€™s public goods infrastructure, WatchDog complements tools like Polkassembly by focusing on delivery oversight, technical verification, and funding transparency, ensuring seamless integration into the ecosystem.
## Impact

WatchDog streamlines grant management, **reduces administrative effort**, and enables **proactive risk mitigation**. By embedding automation and verification into the grant lifecycle, it delivers low-effort, low-cost, high-trust oversight, empowering Polkadotâ€™s community to drive successful outcomes.

## Future

### Sustainability & Monetization
While initial funding from the Polkadot Treasury is required to bootstrap development, the long-term vision includes a hybrid, self-sustaining model through the following revenue strategies:

**Ecosystem/ParaChain Audit Subscriptions**
Partner with Parachains organizations to subsidize audit tooling and monitoring services. Small monthly or quarterly fees will give grantees access to advanced oversight features.

**Tiered API Access**
Offer real-time, verified milestone and treasury data via subscription-based APIs. Pricing tiers will reflect data freshness, query volume, and customization needs (e.g., for analytics firms, dApps, or researchers).

**Premium Analytics Dashboards**
Provide enhanced dashboards for large grantees, foundations, or institutional partners, featuring historical analysis, filtering, and benchmarking across grants.

**Sponsored Integrations**
Collaborate with ecosystem tools and infrastructure projects to integrate WatchDog data, supported by licensing or sponsorship agreements.

## Conclusion
WatchDog introduces a structured, intelligent accountability framework for the Polkadot Treasury and OpenGov. By transforming fragmented and inconsistent grant data into real-time, verifiable insights, it strengthens trust, reduces inefficiencies, and helps ensure the long-term effectiveness of Polkadotâ€™s public funding mechanisms.
